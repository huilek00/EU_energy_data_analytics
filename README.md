# EU Countries Energy Emissions and Efficiency Data Analytics: Regression and Clustering

## Project Overview
This project investigates the **relationship between CO2 intensity and energy sources** in EU countries using **data analytics** and **R language**. The analysis uses a dataset that includes monthly data on electricity generation, power sector emissions, and CO2 intensity. The focus is on identifying the factors that influence CO2 intensity, specifically how electricity generation and power sector emissions from different energy sources contribute to it. **Regression model** is used to explore these relationships, while **clustering model** categorizes energy sources based on their efficiency.

The documentation provides a step-by-step overview of the workflow, covering **data preprocessing**, **model development**, and **result visualization**, all implemented using R, to help understand the impact of energy sources on CO2 intensity.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression and clustering models
- Visualization of results to understand energy efficiency
- R language for data analytics

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/huilek00/EU_energy_data_analytics
    ```

2. Install necessary R packages:
    ```r
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", "cluster"))
    ```

3. Run the R scripts for analysis.
